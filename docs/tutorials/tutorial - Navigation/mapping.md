# Manually map the environment
To manually map the environment, you will need to set up Ego to navigate and create a map of the surroundings. This involves using sensors and cameras to gather data about the environment, which Ego will then use to build a detailed map.
# Autonomous mapping
In addition to manual mapping, Ego can also perform autonomous mapping. This allows Ego to explore the environment and create a map without human intervention. To enable autonomous mapping, you will need to configure Ego's navigation and mapping settings.
