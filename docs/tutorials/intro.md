Ego is designed to be a general purpose **robot companion** that assists users in various tasks. At the same time, it is a powerful tool for developers to create and test robotic applications. Ego provides a flexible framework that allows users to interact with robots in a natural way, while also offering developers the ability to customize and extend its functionality.

Thanks to [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/), Ego can be easily integrated with a wide range of robotic hardware and software components. This makes it an ideal platform for both hobbyists and professionals looking to develop advanced robotic systems.

In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

1. Setting up your development environment
2. Creating your first robot simulation
3. Implementing basic robot behaviors
4. Testing and debugging your robot

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to use Ego to create and control robots effectively.
